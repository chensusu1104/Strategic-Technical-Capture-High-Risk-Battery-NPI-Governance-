# Strategic Thin-Wall Steel Coin Cell Program  
_Pre-Award Line Construction → Statistical Process Governance → Dual-Line NPI Execution (2022–2023)_

---

## Program Overview

Between 2022–2023, a custom thin-wall steel-cased coin cell program for wearable application was secured and executed under strict structural, safety, and statistical process control requirements.

The program included:

- 3-month pre-award technical capture phase  
- Dedicated semi-automatic production line construction (prior to contract award)  
- Full NPI execution (EVT → DVT)  
- Parallel development of a fully customized automation line  
- Station-level statistical process governance  
- Multi-certification battery validation  
- ~50 cross-functional internal team members  

Vendor-side program governance operated under global customer oversight.

## Phase 0 — Pre-Award Engineering & Dedicated Line Construction (3 Months)

Before contract award, a dedicated semi-automatic production line was constructed to demonstrate technical capability.

This line was purpose-built to:

- Validate thin-wall steel shell forming stability  
- Control deformation and dent sensitivity  
- Establish early process yield baselines  
- Integrate high-control electrolyte injection environment  
- Sequence stations based on quality containment logic  

Multiple sample iterations were produced and reviewed during on-site customer audit.

Project award occurred only after production line demonstration and sample approval.

This semi-automatic line later served as the foundation for EVT builds.

## Structural Challenge: Thin-Wall Steel Coin Cell

The product required:

- Custom irregular coin-cell geometry  
- Ultra-thin steel casing  
- High sensitivity to denting and structural deformation  
- Historically unstable outer-shell yield  

Governance required structural stability before NPI progression.

## Statistical Process Governance Model

From EVT onward, process control was treated as structural governance rather than post-failure correction.

Control elements included:

- Station-level yield targets  
- SPC monitoring across critical forming and assembly stations  
- CPK threshold definition for key dimensions  
- Yield gate requirements at stage transitions  
- Deformation rate containment metrics  
- Escalation path for capability instability  

Advancement to next NPI stage required statistical capability compliance.

## Structured NPI Execution

### EVT — Multi-Scheme Engineering Validation (3 Months)

EVT execution included:

- Parallel DOE schemes for capacity and stability optimization  
- Multiple process parameter exploration paths  
- Electrochemical validation  
- Long-duration performance testing  
- DFMEA initiation  
- Station-level yield tracking  
- Risk register deployment  
- Early certification sample submission (including UN transportation testing)  

EVT exit required:

- Converged DOE results  
- Acceptable station capability levels  
- Risk closure at defined thresholds  
- Yield compliance across critical stations  

---

### DVT — Stability Consolidation & Automation Integration (4 Months)

DVT required:

- Final design parameter lock  
- Automation line station validation  
- Process parameter stabilization  
- Repeatability verification  
- Statistical capability re-validation  
- Certification progress alignment  
- Cross-functional gate review  

DVT exit required:

- Verified automation stability  
- Yield threshold compliance  
- Risk register clearance  
- Gate authorization under defined criteria  

---

## Dual-Line Architecture Governance

Two production systems were synchronized:

1. Semi-automatic line (initial capability & EVT builds)  
2. Fully customized automation line (for DVT and scale readiness)  

Automation stability and product validation progressed under shared milestone discipline.

---

## Risk & Gate Authority Model

Risk governance included:

- DFMEA deployment  
- Structured risk register maintenance  
- Station-level risk assessment  
- Shell deformation containment strategy  
- Gate-based authorization logic  

Stage advancement was conditional upon:

- Statistical process capability compliance  
- Structural stability validation  
- Automation repeatability confirmation  
- Certification progression alignment
